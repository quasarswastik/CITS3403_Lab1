Create your own home page
Create an HTML5 home page for yourself. The home page should contain a welcome message, a photo, a bullet list of the units you are studying, with each item in the list linked to the Unit Outline for that unit, and a table containing your timetable. You may find it useful to access some of the HTML5 references provided in the lectures.

Do not be too concerned about page output layout at this stage (tho you should use suitable indentation to show the structure of the page source).

Open the page in Firefox, Chrome and Opera to check that it works as expected. You may also want to have a look at it with Internet Explorer (if you're in Windows). Depending on your operating system, you can also check it under Safari and SeaMonkey.

Try adding a form to the page. The form should collect a users name, email and date of birth. Use HTML5 input types, and check that they work in the browser.

Validation
Validate your HTML5 page using the validation service at:
 http://validator.w3.org/.
Try to fix any problems that appear during validation.
